# Fujisims Update: Apple Photos-Inspired Settings

## Summary
Updated the "Nishti Recipe" camera settings based on your feedback that Apple Photos' auto-edit made your cat photos look really good. The new settings incorporate the brightness, vibrance, and shadow detail that Apple Photos typically enhances.

## What Changed

### Before (Original Nishti Recipe):
- **Shadows**: -2 (Soft Shadows)
- **Color**: +2 (Refined Consensus)
- **Exposure Compensation**: +1.0
- **Sharpening**: +1 (Professional Choice)

### After (Apple Photos-Inspired):
- **Shadows**: -1 (Lifted Shadows) ✨
  - *Reveals more detail in darker areas while maintaining depth*
  
- **Color**: +3 (Enhanced Vibrancy) ✨
  - *Boosted to match Apple Photos' vibrant look while avoiding oversaturation*
  
- **Exposure Compensation**: +1.3 ✨
  - *Increased for that "Apple Photos glow"*
  
- **Sharpening**: +2 (Enhanced Detail) ✨
  - *Crisper details that match Apple Photos' processing*

## Settings That Stayed the Same:
- Film Simulation: Classic Chrome
- Dynamic Range: DR400
- Highlights: -2
- Noise Reduction: -2
- Clarity: -2
- Grain Effect: Weak, Small
- Color Chrome Effect: Strong
- Color Chrome FX Blue: Weak
- White Balance: Auto, -1 Red & -3 Blue
- ISO: Auto (up to 6400)

## Why These Changes Work

Apple Photos' auto-edit typically:
1. **Brightens the image** → We increased Exposure Compensation from +1.0 to +1.3
2. **Lifts shadows** to reveal detail → We changed Shadows from -2 to -1
3. **Adds vibrance** to make colors pop → We boosted Color from +2 to +3
4. **Enhances sharpness** → We increased Sharpening from +1 to +2

These adjustments give you that "wow" factor right out of camera, matching the polished look you got when using Apple Photos' auto-edit on your cat photos.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new settings** on your Fujifilm camera
2. **Compare** with your previous photos
3. **Adjust** if needed based on your specific shooting conditions
